# Face-recognition


#Objective:
To develop a tool to help plastic surgeons make better prediction in Person's beauty

#Subjective:
We use the face data of a person to calculate the beauty ratio using the mathematical model for Golden Ratio

#Uses:
It uses Opencv and Face Landmark detection to identify the data points on face, then uses Euclidean distance to compute the ratio of person. Based on previous generated data it makes prediction on what to do
